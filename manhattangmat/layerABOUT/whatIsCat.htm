      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The GMAT is 
        now offered ONLY on computer, which means that you will no longer use 
        a pencil and paper to answer test questions. Instead, you will sit in 
        front of a computer screen at an official testing center and take the 
        GMAT in its CAT (Computer Adaptive Test) form. The basic features of the 
        CAT format are as follows:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">* You will 
        see only one question on the screen at a time. Therefore, you may not 
        skip around in a section and answer questions in the order that you please. 
        If you skip a question you will not be allowed to return to it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">* The test 
        is designed to adapt to your personal ability by giving you questions 
        that reflect how well you have answered previous questions. Test questions 
        are not pre-set in advance. Instead, as you take the test, new questions 
        are generated for you based on how well you are doing. The test begins 
        with a question of medium difficulty. If you answer this first question 
        correctly, you will receive a slightly harder second question. If you 
        do not, you will receive a slightly easier second question. Your third 
        question, in turn, will be based on both your response to the second question 
        and its difficulty level. In this way, the computer seeks to zero in on 
        your ability level and assign you a corresponding score.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">* Due to the 
        GMAT's computer adaptive format, scores are not determined solely by the 
        number of correct answers. Correct responses to difficult questions are 
        worth more than correct responses to easy questions. Therefore, in order 
        to score well you must be able to answer the more difficult questions 
        correctly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">* No matter 
        your ability level, the CAT is designed to present you with a fair mix 
        of questions for the content areas within a given section. For example, 
        in the math section, all test-takers will receive roughly the same mix 
        of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry questions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">* Prior to 
        the exam, there will be a computer tutorial designed to help you become 
        familiar with computerized testing. You will be allowed as much time as 
        you need to review the computerized format and practice entering in answers.
